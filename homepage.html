            This is a website made by me for just learning HTML,CSS,JS,PYTHON,SQL all together. I hope to improve it even further in future, as it is just the in the basic state right
            now where i am more focused on the full functioning of the website, hope you like it! This includes SQL server connection to the website through Python, and the website has been
            made with the help of HTML,styled with CSS, and the functions working are coded through JS.
